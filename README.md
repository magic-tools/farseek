Coretapper
===

_In memoriam cockatrice.de, mtgimage.com, and many other projects killed by WotC_

DISCLAIMER
---

Coretapper is merely a study in PureScript, please don't deploy it anywhere.

If you deploy it somewhere, please don't tell us about your deployment, so
that when WotC goes turns on community favourite
C&D-[blackmail](http://magiccards.info/scans/en/on/127.jpg)-shit-fan,
all of us can honestly tell them that we shut our deployment down and don't
know of any other deployments of this code.

â€¦

Not like we're going to deploy this code anywhere anyway. Remember, it's
just a study in PureScript.

ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
---

This repository contains code which fetches JSON card database from either
mtgjson, or, if it gets C&D'ed, from some other mirror and transforms it from
mtgjson format into coretapper format, saving the result of its work in
`~/.farseek` directory. Other tools may assume that this is the place where
you have coretapper-compatible JSON card database. They shouldn't, but they may.

Because who has time for proper configuration facilities in their pet projects.

Right? Right?!
